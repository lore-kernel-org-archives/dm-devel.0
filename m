I did the stamping selection other than how long have we been solo based
on these possibly wrong speculations:

If we're in the idle window and doing the async drain thing, we've at
the spot where Vivek's patch helps a ton.  Seemed like a great time to
limit the size of any io that may land in front of my sync reader to
plain "you are not alone" quantity.

If we've got sync io in flight, that should mean that my new or old
known seeky queue has been serviced at least once.  There's likely to be
more on the way, so delay overloading then too. 

The seeky bit is supposed to be the earlier "last time we saw a seeker"
thing, but known seeky is too late to help a new task at all unless you
turn off the overloading for ages, so I added the if incalculable check
for good measure, hoping that meant the task is new, may want to exec.

Stamping any place may (see below) possibly limit the size of the io the
reader can generate as well as writer, but I figured what's good for the
goose is good for the the gander, or it ain't really good.  The overload
was causing the observed pain, definitely ain't good for both at these
times at least, so don't let it do that.

Dunno, I was just tossing rocks and sticks at it.

I don't really understand the reasoning behind overloading:  I can see
that allows cutting thicker slabs for the disk, but with the streaming
writer vs reader case, seems only the writers can do that.  The reader
is unlikely to be alone isn't it?  Seems to me that either dd, a flusher
thread or kjournald is going to be there with it, which gives dd a huge
advantage.. it has two proxies to help it squabble over disk, konsole
has none.
