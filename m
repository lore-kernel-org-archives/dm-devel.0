ra_pages never got inherited by stacking drivers, check it by modifying
it on an underlying device and then creating a trivial dm or md one.
And I think that is a good thing - in general we shouldn't really mess
with this thing from drivers if we can avoid it.  I've kept the legacy
aoe and md parity raid cases, out of which the first looks pretty weird
and the md one at least remotely sensible.

->io_pages is still inherited in disk_stack_limits, just like before
so no change either.
