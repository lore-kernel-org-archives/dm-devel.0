Unfortunately it is for device-mapper. libdevmapper
depends on information that uevent was sent because udev rules uses
semaphore to inform that some action was taken.
So if dm-ioctl returns flag that uevent was not sent, it fallback
to different error path (otherwise it waits for completion forever).
(TBH I am more and more convinced this was not quite clever concept.)

But the whole concept "send event to the list of namespaces, maybe someone listen"
seems also not quite clever to me :-)

How much time consuming is that? If you create thousand(s) of cloned namespaces,
how it will perform with uevent notification performance?
(IOW first event is sent through netlink and 999+ reports failure... strange.)
