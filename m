Then I guess this is fixable in kobject_uevent_env.  I'm not certain
it is smart to support this case but it appears supportable.

In the case of ESRCH I completely agree.

We are currently ignoring errors in the semantically more interesting
case when netlink_broadcast does not deliver the packet to one of the
listening netlink sockets.

How does this patch look?
