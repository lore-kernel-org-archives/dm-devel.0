I guess it would be hard to implement it, and we need to hold requests
and throttle them at there and it would break the ordering by CFQ.

Yes, I know it.

But I think that the higher level approch makes easy to configure
against striped software raid devices. If one would like to
combine some physical disks into one logical device like a dm-linear,
I think one should map the IO controller on each physical device and
combine them into one logical device.

I think that it would be better to use the higher-level controller
along with the memory controller and have limits memory usage for each
cgroup. And as Kamezawa-san said, having limits of dirty pages would
be better, too.

Yes, I've released new versions of dm-ioband and blkio-cgroup. The new
dm-ioband handles sync/async IO requests separately and
the write-starve-read issue you pointed out is fixed. I would
appreciate it if you would try them.
