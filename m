Fine in theory, hard in practice. :)

I think the best we can hope for is to keep parity with what happens in
the rest of the kernel.  We already have a problem today with people
mmap()'ing lots of memory and dirtying it all at once.  Adding a i/o
bandwidth controller or a memory controller isn't really going to fix
that.  I think it is outside the scope of the i/o (and memory)
controllers until we solve it generically, first.
