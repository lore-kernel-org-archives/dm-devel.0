And another test which makes it obvious that your patch works:

[root@c1501 ~]# dd if=test.img of=test2.img bs=1M count=6000
6000+0 records in
6000+0 records out
6291456000 bytes (6.3 GB) copied, 210.466 s, 29.9 MB/s

[root@c1500 ~]# dd if=test.img of=test2.img bs=1M count=3000
3000+0 records in
3000+0 records out
3145728000 bytes (3.1 GB) copied, 201.118 s, 15.6 MB/s


So a file that is twice the size of another one (6vs3 g) is copied for
almost the same amount of time with 2x the bandwidth.
