Sure, not saying that it did.  But if the goal is to set ra_pages based
on io_opt then to do that correctly on stacking drivers it must be done
in terms of limits stacking right?  Or at least done at a location that
is after the limits stacking has occurred?  So should DM just open-code
setting ra_pages like it did for io_pages?

Because setting ra_pages in __device_add_disk() is way too early for DM
-- given it uses device_add_disk_no_queue_reg via add_disk_no_queue_reg
at DM device creation (before stacking all underlying devices' limits).

I don't want drivers, like DM, to have to worry about these.  So I agree
with that goal ;)

I'm missing where, but I only looked closer at this 06/14 patch.
In it I see io_pages is no longer adjusted in disk_stack_limits().
