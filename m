Adding this extra check in update_vtime() is tricky. If we don't
update vtime, then its possible that lookup would return no entity,
even though there are backlogged queues, as all backlogged entities
might be not eligible (i.e have start times bigger than vtime).
When an entity is currently under service, we don't know what would be
the next entity really, as it could be the current entity under
service, depending on the actual time slice used by under service
entity.

You are right that the lookup (without extract) was done only in
preemption path. And with your latest changes, even that is removed.
In this case, just having a BUG_ON() to ensure this does not happen
should suffice.

    Add a BUG_ON() that should fire when we can update vtime while just
    doing a lookup for next entity (and not extraction).

I have some concerns about the new preemption logic. We modify the
start and finish time to make sure the entity gets selected next. So
the entity which preempts others can eventually get more service than
others (specially if it keeps preempting others). It seems that we can
fix that by temporarily pushing the entity to the front, without
modifying start/finish times. One way to do that is to add an extra
flag to an entity. When the flag is set, we can ignore finish times
and prefer the entity (in bfq_first_active_entity()). This has the
advantage that since we are preserving start/finish times, over time,
such an entity will be de-prioritized over others. In order to ensure
that actually does happen, we can introduce a threshold (call it
preempt_threshold). Then the entity with the flag set would jump to
the front only if the difference between 'its finish time' and 'the
finish time of other entities' is within this threshold. Let me know
if it makes sense.
