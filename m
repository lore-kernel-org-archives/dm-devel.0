Lot of CFQ code is all about maintaining per io context queues, for
different classes and different prio level, about anticipation for
reads etc. Anybody who wants to get classes and ioprio within cgroup
right will end up duplicating all that logic (to cover all the cases).
So I did not mean that you will end up copying the whole code but
logically a lot of it.

Secondly, there will be mismatch in anticipation logic. CFQ gives
preference to reads and for dependent readers it idles and waits for
next request to come. A higher level throttling can interefere with IO
pattern of application and can lead CFQ to think that average thinktime
of this application is high and disable the anticipation on that
application. Which should result in high latencies for simple commands
like "ls", in presence of competing applications.

IO scheduler based solution is highly customizable. First of all there
are compile time switches to either completely remove fair queuing code
(for noop, deadline and AS only) or to disable group scheduling only. If
that's the case one would expect same behavior as old scheduler.

Secondly, even if everything is compiled in and customer is not using
cgroups, I would expect almost same behavior (because we will have only
root group). There will be extra code in the way and we will need some
optimizations to detect that there is only one group and bypass as much
code as possible bringing the overhead of the new code to the minimum. 

So if customer is not using IO controller, he should get the same behavior
as old system. Can't prove it right now because my patches are not in that
matured but there are no fundamental design limitations.
