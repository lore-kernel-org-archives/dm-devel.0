Placing the full struct where you did is highly disruptive to the prior
care taken to tune alignment of struct members within mapped_device.

Switching to a pointer will be less so, but even still it might be best
to either find a hole in the struct (not looked recently, but there may
not be one) or simply put it at the end of the structure.

The pahole utility is very useful for this kind of struct member
placement, etc.  But it is increasingly unavailable in modern Linux
distros...
