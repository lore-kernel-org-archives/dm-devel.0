  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  is also made

For a while I was confused thinking that the new attribute is not writeable
but when I checked the code I saw that it is.

Not supporting stable_pages_required attribute is not nice but probably it
isn't widely used. Maybe the deprecation message can even mention to use
the queue attribute? Otherwise the patch looks good to me so feel free to
add:
