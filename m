Writes which go through page cache.

No, once the bio is submitted to dm device it could be a buffered write or
a direct write.

Worker thread will most likely be in root cgroup. So if a worker thread
is submitting bio, it will be attributed to root cgroup.

We had similar issue with IO priority and it did not work reliably with
CFQ on underlying device when dm devices were sitting on top.

If we really want to give it a try, I guess we will have to put cgroup
info of submitter early in bio at the time of bio creation even for all
kind of IO. Not sure if it is worth the effort.

For the case of IO throttling, I think you should put throttling rules on
the dm device itself. That means as long as filesystem supports the
cgroups, you should be getting right cgroup information for all kind of
IO and throttling should work just fine.

Thanks
