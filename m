Hi Vivek,

This mail is about hierarchical grouping facility for IO controller.

I can implement the hierarchical grouping facility if really necessary
and the patch will be released after dm-ioband is merged into the
kernel. But do you believe the hierarchical grouping facility should
be implemented in the kernel, even if we can do it in the userland?
I think disk bandwidth control doesn't need responsiveness like the
CPU scheduler. I know it's possible to implement in the kernel, but
does it only make the kernel complex?

The current cgroup framework can't manage resources dynamically. The
reason for using a cgroup ID to specify a cgroup is that it makes the
implementation quite simple. Although it is possible to implement the
function without using the ID, it makes the kernel complex due to the
function has to be implemented outside of the kernel.
