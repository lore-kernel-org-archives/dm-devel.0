Nikolay,

I am not sure how well it will work with CFQ of underlying device. It will
get cgroup information right for buffered writes. But cgroup information
for reads and direct writes will come from submitter's context and if dm
layer gets in between, then many a times submitter might be a worker
thread and IO will be attributed to that worker's cgroup (root cgroup).

Give it a try anyway.

Thanks
Vivek
