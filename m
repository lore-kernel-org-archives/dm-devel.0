As it stands, imagine that you have a hypervisor node running many VMs (or 
containers), each of which is assigned a separate logical volume (possibly 
thin-provisioned) as its rootfs.

Ideally we want the disk accesses by those VMs to be "fair" relative to each 
other, and we want to guarantee a certain amount of bandwidth for the host as well.

Without this sort of feature, how can we accomplish that?

IO throttling isn't all that useful, since it requires you to know in advance 
what your IO rate is.  And it doesn't adjust nicely as the number of competing 
entities changes the way that weight-based schemes do.
