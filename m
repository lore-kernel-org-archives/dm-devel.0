Hi Jerome, 

Can you also run the AS test with io controller patches and both the
database in root group (basically don't put them in to separate group). I 
suspect that this regression might come from that fact that we now have
to switch between queues and in AS we wait for request to finish from
previous queue before next queue is scheduled in and probably that is
slowing down things a bit.., just a wild guess..

Thanks
Vivek
