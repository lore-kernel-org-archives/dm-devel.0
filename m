As of now, you can't. I will try adding bio_associate_current() and see
if that along with Mike's patches gets you what you are looking for.

On a side note, have you tried using CFQ's proportional logic with multile
VMs. Say partition the disk and pass each parition to VM/container and
do the IO. My main concern is that by default each cgroup can add
significant idling overhead and kill overall throughput of disk
(especially for random IO or if cgroup does not have enough IO to keep
disk busy).

One can disable group idling but that kills service differentiation for
most of the workloads.

So I was curious to know if CFQ's proportional bandwidth division is
helping you in real life. (without dm of course).

Agreed that absolute limits are less useful as compared to dynamic limits
provided by weights. This is more useful for scenario where a cloud
provider does not want to provide disk bandwidth if user has not paid for
it (even if disk bandwidth is available).
