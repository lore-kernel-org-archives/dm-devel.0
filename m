I forgot to explicitly mention that running clone with CLONE_NEWNET
causes kobject_uevent_env() to fail _outside_ of cloned namespace
(for all kernel users in fact).

(The former problem is described here
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.device-mapper.dm-crypt/5256
but it is IMHO generic problem. Instrumenting  kobject_uevent() shows
that it returns send failure really to all events.)

Can anyone please explain this behavior?
