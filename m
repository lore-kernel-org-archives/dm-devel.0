OK, I think this should do it.  Nikolay and/or others can you test this
patch using blkio cgroups controller with LVM devices and report back?

Subject: [PATCH] block: transfer source bio's cgroup tags to clone via bio_associate_blkcg()

Move btrfs_bio_clone()'s support for transferring a source bio's cgroup
tags to a clone into both bio_clone_bioset() and __bio_clone_fast().
The former is used by btrfs (MD and blk-core also use it via bio_split).
The latter is used by both DM and bcache.

This should enable the blkio cgroups controller to work with all
stacking bio-based block devices.
