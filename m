Ok, here is my understanding. Tejun, please correct me if that's not the
case anymore. I have not been able to keep pace with all the recent work.

IO throttling policies should be applied on top level dm devices and these
should work for reads and direct writes.

For IO throttling buffered writes, I think it might not work on dm devices
as it because we might not be copying cgroup information when cloning
happens in dm layer.

IIRC, one concern with cloning cgroup info from parent bio was that how
would one take care of any priority inversion issues. For example, we are
waiting for a clone to finish IO which is in severely throttled IO cgroup
and rest of the IO can't proceed till that IO finishes).

IIUC, there might not be a straight forward answer to that question. We
probably will have to look at all the dm code closely and if that
serialization is possible in any of the paths, then reset the cgroup info.

For CFQ's proportional policy, it might not work well when a dm device
is sitting on top. And reason being that for all reads and direct writes
we inherit cgroup from submitter and dm might be submitting IO from an
internal thread, hence losing the cgroup of submitter hence IO gets
misclassified at dm level.

To solve this, we will have to carry submitter's cgroup info in bio and
clones and again think of priority inversion issues.

Thanks
