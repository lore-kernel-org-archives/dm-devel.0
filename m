Can you try following also along with Mike's patch of carrying cgroup
info over the clones.

Mike, is it right place in dm layer to hook into. I think this will take
care of bio based targets.

Even after this I think there are still two issues.

- bio_associate_current() assumes that submitter already has an io context
  otherwise does nothing. So in this case if container/VM process does not
  have io context, nothing will happen.

- We will also need mechanism to carry io context information when we 
  clone bio. Otherwise we will get the cgroup of the original process
  and io context of the dm thread (kind of odd).
