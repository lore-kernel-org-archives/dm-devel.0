 Right, what's your definition of  buffered writes? My mental model is that
when a process submits a write request to a dm device , the bio is going to
be put on a devi e workqueue which would then  be serviced by a background
worker thread and later the submitter notified. Do you refer to this whole
gamut of operations as buffered writes?

for reads and direct writes will come from submitter's context and if dm

Be that as it may, proivded that the worker thread is in the  'correct'
cgroup,  then the appropriate babdwidth policies should apply, no?
