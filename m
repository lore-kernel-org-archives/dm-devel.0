Throttling does work even now,  but the use case I had in mind was
proportional
distribution of IO. Imagine 50  or so dm devices, hosting IO intensive
workloads. In
this situation, I'd  be interested each of them getting proportional IO
based on the weights
set in the blkcg controller for each respective cgroup for every workload.

No, once the bio is submitted to dm device it could be a buffered write or<=

a direct write.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; for reads and direct writes will come from submitter&#39;s context and=

<br>
Worker thread will most likely be in root cgroup. So if a worker thread<br>
is submitting bio, it will be attributed to root cgroup.<br>
<br>
We had similar issue with IO priority and it did not work reliably with<br>
