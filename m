I think we don't need any limitation for RT tasks. If somebody needs to
limit RT task, then it should be put into a separate group.

Looks like you have started duplicating CFQ infrastrucutre in dm-ioband to
make sure CFQ is not broken. That will lead to interesting interaction
with noop and other IO schedulers at the same time whenever CFQ changes 
behavior you will find it hard to keep up with it. 

Anyway, how are you taking care of priorities with-in same class. How will
you make sure that a BE prio 0 request is not hidden behind BE prio 7
request? Same is true for prio with-in RT class.

Thanks
Vivek
