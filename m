In my particular case I did ensure that the underlying /dev/sda scheduler was 
set to CFQ.  I had expected that would be sufficient.

In my case the process is placed in a cgroup, which is assigned a relative 
weight.  I didn't specify any of per-device weights.

My suspicion is that the cgroup information for the writing process is being 
lost as the request passes through the DM layer.

This is disappointing, given how long both DM and cgroups have been around.
