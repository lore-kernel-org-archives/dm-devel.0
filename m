If I understand your description and the code right the guarantee that
you need is that kobject_uevent will return success only if it has
queued a packet in every listening netlink socket.

We already ignore ENOBUFS so the guarantee you appear to need in
libdevmapper does not appear to be present in kobject_uevent.

Does the libdevmapper code work despite getting a spurious failure?

If libdevmapper does not work despite a spurious failure I don't see how
we could possibly fix kobject_uevent when there is more than one netlink
listener.
