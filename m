The weighed mode of blkio works only with CFQ scheduler. And as far as I
have seen you cannot set CFQ to be the scheduler of DM devices. In this
case you can use the BLK io throttling mechanism. That's what I've
encountered in my practice. Though I'd be happy to be proven wrong by
someone. I believe the following sentence in the blkio controller states
that:
"
First one is proportional weight time based division of disk policy. It
is implemented in CFQ. Hence this policy takes effect only on leaf nodes
when CFQ is being used.
